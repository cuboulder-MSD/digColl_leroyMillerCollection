Shimeld. 00:00:02 Athens, capital of Greece, was a thriving village as long ago as 1068 B.C., which time, as you know was several centuries before Columbus discovered America, or before the Turks started the harem vogue. 00:00:39 There is no authority for the statement, but it is supposed the first Greek restaurant and candy store was started in Athens about 404 B.C., when Hippocrates and Socrates were front page news. 00:01:19 Athens isn't what it was in those good old days of freedom, when men warred a lot, talked more, and had a generally good time getting the world all fixed up for the United States to take over its financial troubles. 00:01:58 Still, Athens isn't such a bad place in these days. If those Turks would just let them alone, those Greeks might build another Parthenon. 00:02:28 The Parthenon, dating back to the Sixth century, B.C., is considered the ""most perfect monument of the ancient art."" 00:03:00 In its ruins today it presents an imposing and soul-stirring spectacle. 00:03:24 The Parthenon occupies, in Athens, the culminating point of the Acropolis, a rocky plateau of crystalline limestone, rising 510 feet above the sea. 00:03:49 The stadium, built of Pentellic marble in B.C. 330, and restored twice since then, is the field on which the original Olympic games were held. 00:04:18 It seats 50,000 spectators.00:04:34 The king's body guard would make a hit in any musical show. 00:05:12 The Boulevard de l'Universite. 00:05:39 On this street are the Academy of Science and the University. 00:06:15 Boulevard de l'Universite ends at the Place de la Concorde, a square much frequented of an evening. 00:07:00 The side-walk, or boulevard, cafe is a characteristic part of Athens. 00:07:29 The Rue de Stade. 00:07:50 On another street. 00:08:11 ""Fresh vegetable."" 00:08:42 Athens is filled with photographers, for a Greek likes to have his picture taken, not just once a year, but every month or so. 00:09:49 The National Museum. 00:10:14 The Lykabettos, a finely-shaped hill in the north-eastern part of the town, is a prominent feature of Athens. 00:10:59 ""Oh thou, our Athens, violet-wreathed, brilliant, most enviable city."" - Aristophanes. 00:11:38 End of recording.","City and town life","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/862081","","","","","Cities and towns","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/861748","Restaurants","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1095907","Ruins in art","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1101205","Universities and colleges","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1161597","Photography","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1061714","Museums","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1030128","","","","","Parthenon (Athens, Greece)","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/631410","Ethnikon Archaiologikon Mouseion (Greece)","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/519198","","","","","","","","","Greece--Athens","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1204474","Greece--Athens--Acropolis","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1316151","France--Paris--Place de la Concorde","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1714355","","","","","","","","","U183051010579_narv_millerLeroy_5-5_athensGreece_a.mp4","https://ark.colorado.edu/ark:/47540/s44z5t73g1zv","video/mp4","https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/video/mp4","reformatted digital","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Do not let this startle you, it is only a matter of seven genuine dollars. 00:02:17 What a lot of junk! But of a certainty! This is the workshop where junks are made mended and sent a stream in search of adventure. 00:03:10 Every day is washday - for no respectable pot fancies a blackened reputation. 00:04:11 Lazy paddle-strokes led us past the pottery yards, where world-famous curios where dreamily stunning themselves, speculating, perhaps, a trip to that wonder-America. 00:04:42 Dignity mothers all occupations - even the logs are slow-moving in their journey to market. 00:05:33 And the ducks are nowise anxious to compete. To the Chinese, there is no devil worshipper as green-eyed as the God Haste. From sunrise to sundown twinkling toes pitter-patter tirelessly upon the Royal Arch Bridge. Built for a mighty emperor in the Ninth Century, it is 1200 feet long with all of 53 arches. 00:07:18 A tight squeeze is only an evidence of the great affection found in the archful Canal mistress. 00:07:49 At times traveling as accomplished by running ropes abank, tugged man-fashion along the skirted shore. 00:08:03 Like graceful swans the junks sail by --- their paper wings open to the vagabond breeze. 00:08:24 Thirsty are the rice-fields and of a great generosity indeed the Grand Canal which irrigates far lands and whips the lillies into bloom for paper making. 00:09:03 What ho! The Cormorants, trained fishing birds. A ring is slipped around their necks which prevents their swallowing the catch. Su-chow turns its back upon the Canal. It would not be fitting modesty for vain houses to grow the vainer preening in their own reflections. 00:10:59 Even the youngsters scamper off like frightened lambs, tho one young maiden was undecided between propriety and a proffered peppermint stick. 00:11:31 Midstream a temple of worship for boatmen. We straightway sympathized with the sinful landlubber who boasted no craft to convey this black soul across. 00:12:02 The leaning Pagoda of Su-chow where the emerald God brings luck to the deserving and ill to those who visit him gift-less. 00:12:34 Even the sun seeks a dignified level, bringing peace upon the land and calm into the hearts of the turbulent.

Paved streets, trolley cars, motors, and electric lights, all testify to her vigorous awakening. And yet there still remains amid this clamor, the ambling bullock, that amiable beastie without which no Philippine family is complete. 00:07:56 The bullock is frequently the best looking member of thw household. Compare him, for instance, with the native woman of his class. 00:08:21 When you arrive at the Manila Hotel you find it a fit rival for the gigantic hostelries of the California coast. 00:08:47 The Army and Navy Club, to which you stroll for cafe noire, provides another glimpse of home. 00:09:11 A few minutes walk in any direction brings you to one of the many canals which suggest the city's name ""The Venice of the Orient."" 00:09:49 Through the heart of town runs the Pasig where all day long the native women bang the family laundry on great ""washing stones."" 00:10:18 And during all its winding length, the Pasig bathes the bullock and the boy impartially. 00:10:46 Bilibid Prison. Previous to American occupation it was full of pitiful wrecks of humanity who had been imprisoned without trial or hearing for many years. 00:11:05 Now it is one of the best in the world. 00:11:46 Two Filipino women wearing their native dress made from pina cloth or fiber of the pineapple leaf. 00:12:30 But among the Filipinos of the suburbs great cockingmains bear evidence of a vice which is still the curse of the whole race. 00:13:04 From this outward sign of an inward and innate barbarity, one turns gratefully again to the opal sea with its silent ships and softly lapping waters. 00:13:38 Great clouds drift on the Sky like phantom ships of long-dead Emperors: and from their sides, bursts of exotic color drop into the Garden of the Bay. 00:14:35 End of recording.","Hemp market","local","","","","","Vinta boats","local","Bangka boats","local","Cargo ships","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/847405","Philippine Constabulary.

Thousands of people depend upon the freight trade for a livelihood and on these small boats the owners make their homes. 00:02:17 Unloading a boat is always interesting. Here they clearly demonstrate that a boost is better than a knock. 00:02:45 Women work in Japan - dancing while pile driving has its drawback in more ways than one. 00:03:45 After the women do the light (?) work, men do the heavy work. 00:03:59 Yes, they are drilling for oil. Should they strike a ""gusher"" this bamboo derrick would look like a bunch of toothpicks. 00:04:32 With bad roads and worse horses, human assistance always comes to the front - mostly the rear in this case. 00:04:59 The strength and endurance required for hard labor, is obtained by eating rice. Here we found the entire family making rice cakes, with the rooster bossing the job. 00:05:32 Putting the punch in it - when eating them they remind you of a cross between a ""gumdrop"" and a ""jawbreaker"" and taste like a fur rug. 00:06:13 After rice cakes, babies come next in number - aren't they cute? 00:06:43 In spite of devoted care 350 out of every 1000 die before reaching the age of five. 00:07:32 They start training them young to be entertainers of Geisha Girls - 00:09:02 - but during Cherry Blossom time the training is almost forgotten. 00:09:30 The heavy cherry blossom odor some times produces hilarity. 00:10:03 When evening comes the Geisha return home like tired children. 00:10:19 To become a policeman the physical examination has but one fault. It is tough that when a fellow once passes it he is ready to retire and spend the rest of his life recuperating. 00:11:04 Of course if a fellow gets hit hard enough on the arm to break it, that doesn't count, it's a foul. 00:11:45 When one gets real good at this lady-like sport, he may be signed up for the main event and win a large floral piece. 00:12:30 Police duties of Japan compare with those of other countries. Massaging the cobble streets and directing traffic occupies most of their time. 00:12:52 This is the busiest corner in the Empire. Count them yourself. There are enough officers present to personally conduct an auto party across the street. 00:13:39 No, not Venus at the pump, but the city street sprinkling department.

Chester in Co-operation with Outing The great outdoor magazine Edited and Titled by Katherine Killiker. 00:00:03 There are different ways to travel in Japan. Some people trust themselves to a steam dragon like this... 00:00:27 Traveling by this train, we felt like a ""milk-shake"" at the end of the route, where the woman stoker manicures the ""donkey engine"". 00:01:17 ...But we are a cautious soul and we went around in a rickshaw. 00:01:33 Outside our hotel in Yokohama we watched the rickshaw men on dull days gambling for the next passenger. 00:01:56 The cheapest thing in Japan is human labor. Why spend all one's money for an ox when one has a goat in the family? 00:02:31 Curiosity is the besetting sin of the human race. We went forth in search of the unusual... 00:02:45 And found plenty of human interest. 00:03:05 Our peppiest scene...... 00:03:22 ...Turned out like this. 00:03:47 Tokio is a busy place...in spots. 00:04:09 But nobody elbowed the street sprinkler. He had the highway much to himself with the lid off the speed limit. 00:05:05 On our way to Kyoto we came on a fisherman with a circular fishing net which he wielded in lariat fashion. 00:05:16 But after watching him for a while we decided that fish busting was too strenuous for us. A well upholstered river bank with a piece of show string 00:05:16 But after watching him for a while we decided that fish busting was too strenuous for us. A well upholstered river bank with a piece of show string and a crooked pin is more our speed and anyway, who wants to eat more than one fish at a time? 00:05:41 At first we felt that it must be a reception committee... 00:05:53 ....But then, somewhat disillusioned, we learned that it was a procession of Kyoto sandwich men advertising the big show of the season. 00:06:14 It took a long session in Teapot Lane to quench the memory of that show... 00:06:31 And not even an enticing poster could lure us back into Theatre street. 00:07:00 Our next sally was farther north into the land of quaint villages, picturesque mountains, streams and waterfalls. 00:08:14 The lady is not jingled. She is performing the simple act of polishing the veranda in the easiest way... 00:08:33 ....But it is rather unsettling after one's first uncomfortable night in a Japanese inn, to catch sight of the flying dirt chaser charging up and down the veranda in the early morning like a demented train of cars. 00:09:02 At Nikko we discovered the famous sacred bridge over which only members of the royal family are allowed to pass, but having nothing royal in our family but baking powder, we went right on by. 00:09:27 We looked up the Yomeimon Gate which is said to be one of the finest pieces of sculpture in Japan. 00:09:46 Also the great Korean lantern and the Chinese gate. 00:10:11 Then we found the original Three Wise Monkeys and they looked wiser than ever. 00:10:23 They reminded us to ""hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil,"" so we refrained from murdering the rickshaw man as we had intended, and let him lug us back to Tokio for a fresh start. 00:11:24 Bits of life in Japan. 00:11:26 Graceful use of chopsticks. 00:11:31 Dainty in all things, see how daintily they dine --- 00:11:47 Japanese ""table manners"" are in many ways more ""civilized"" than ours --- Chop-sticks are capable of more graceful manipulation than knives and forks and spoons --- 00:12:32 Rice takes the place of bread and is eaten from a bowl held close to the mouth --- 00:13:01 Other foods are so cut and prepared as to be readily picked up by the slender wooden ""HASHI"" -- Japanese meals are the NEATEST in the world --- 00:14:48 Our ways of serving food seem crude and our knife and fork work clumsy in comparison --- 00:14:48 End of recording.","Rickshaws ","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1097580","Stone carving","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1133837","","","Chopsticks ","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/858514","Food habits","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/930807","Steam locomotives","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1132241","Railroad trains","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1431189","City and town life","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/862081","Street sprinklers","local","Fishing ","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/926650","Villages ","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1166969","","","","","","","","","","","","","Japan ","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1204082","Japan--Nikko?-shi","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1210132","Japan--Kyoto","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1207923","","","","","","","","","U183051011101_narv_millerLeroy_6-17_wentToSeaInRickshawJapaneseTeaParty_a.mp4","https://ark.colorado.edu/ark:/47540/pq2x5c7952sb","video/mp4","https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/video/mp4","reformatted digital","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.
