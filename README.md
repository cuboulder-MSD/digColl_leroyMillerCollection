# Leroy H. Miller Collection

## Description
This collection contains silent 16mm travel films created and collected by Boulder-based businessman Leroy H. Miller, ca. 1920s-1930s. Miller traveled throughout the United States, South America, Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often aboard planned cruises. His films were later screened with accompanying lectures to various social clubs and organizations in the Boulder area.

Reels in this collection include both original footage by Leroy H. Miller and footage acquired by Miller from other sources, all from the perspective of American or European travelers. In the 1930s, intertitles were added to the original footage, providing identification, background information, and commentary, sometimes including derogatory or potentially offensive language. The language used and opinions shared in these films do not reflect the current preferred terminology of individuals of marginalized identities, or the values and norms of the CU Boulder Archives.
