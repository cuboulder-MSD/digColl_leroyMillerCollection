Yet these 3000 islands produce everything from pepper to pearls and from tobacco to touring cars. 00:49 Animated map sequence showcasing where geographically the Philippines are. 00:01:04 Manila, the capital city, and the greatest hemp market in the world, is rapidly becoming the chief distributing center for all American goods consigned to the Far East. 00:01:24 Animated map picturing Manila. 00:01:32 Manila Bay, however, you will be pleased to find unchanged since the day of Dewey's victory in 1898. 00:02:08 Here are the same old ""vintas"" spreading their wings like giant birds of prey, sailing to and fro forever on their silent quests of fish. 00:02:43 And here, beyond the old Lighthouse you can still see Manila stretching out her arms to you, around the Bay. 00:03:14 Not until you have got inside the harbor, do you see how this fat old Spanish city has awakened from her sleep of centuries. 00:03:55 All along the brand-new wharves are vintas, bancas, Chinese junks, and American freighters,--eager messengers of commerce, waiting to be fed. 00:04:54 The wonderful Philippine Constabulary Band welcomes us. 00:05:42 The City also has undergone a transformation. Paved streets, trolley cars, motors, and electric lights, all testify to her vigorous awakening. And yet there still remains amid this clamor, the ambling bullock, that amiable beastie without which no Philippine family is complete. 00:07:56 The bullock is frequently the best looking member of thw household. Compare him, for instance, with the native woman of his class. 00:08:21 When you arrive at the Manila Hotel you find it a fit rival for the gigantic hostelries of the California coast. 00:08:47 The Army and Navy Club, to which you stroll for cafe noire, provides another glimpse of home. 00:09:11 A few minutes walk in any direction brings you to one of the many canals which suggest the city's name ""The Venice of the Orient."" 00:09:49 Through the heart of town runs the Pasig where all day long the native women bang the family laundry on great ""washing stones."" 00:10:18 And during all its winding length, the Pasig bathes the bullock and the boy impartially. 00:10:46 Bilibid Prison. Previous to American occupation it was full of pitiful wrecks of humanity who had been imprisoned without trial or hearing for many years. 00:11:05 Now it is one of the best in the world. 00:11:46 Two Filipino women wearing their native dress made from pina cloth or fiber of the pineapple leaf. 00:12:30 But among the Filipinos of the suburbs great cockingmains bear evidence of a vice which is still the curse of the whole race. 00:13:04 From this outward sign of an inward and innate barbarity, one turns gratefully again to the opal sea with its silent ships and softly lapping waters. 00:13:38 Great clouds drift on the Sky like phantom ships of long-dead Emperors: and from their sides, bursts of exotic color drop into the Garden of the Bay. 00:14:35 End of recording.","Hemp market","local","Vinta boats","local","Bangka boats","local","Cargo ships","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/847405","Philippine Constabulary.
